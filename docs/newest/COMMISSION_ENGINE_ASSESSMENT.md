## Commission Engine Overview

### **What's Been Done**

#### 1. **Database Structure (Complete)** ✅
- **Tables Created**:
  - `msc_sales_reps` - Stores sales rep information with parent/sub-rep relationships
  - `commission_rules` - Flexible rules for commission rates by product/category/manufacturer
  - `commission_records` - Individual commission entries for each order item
  - `commission_payouts` - Aggregated payouts for sales reps
  - `orders` table has `sales_rep_id` field

#### 2. **Models (Complete)** ✅
- `MscSalesRep` - Sales rep model with parent/sub relationships
- `CommissionRule` - Rule-based commission rates
- `CommissionRecord` - Individual commission records
- `CommissionPayout` - Payout aggregation model
- Proper relationships defined between all models

#### 3. **Core Services (Complete)** ✅
- **CommissionRuleFinderService**: Finds applicable commission rates (product → manufacturer → category → default)
- **OrderItemCommissionCalculatorService**: Calculates commissions with parent/sub-rep splits
- **OrderCommissionProcessorService**: Processes commissions for entire orders
- **PayoutCalculatorService**: Generates, approves, and processes payouts

#### 4. **Basic Controllers (Partial)** ⚠️
- `CommissionController` - Basic CRUD operations
- `CommissionRuleController` - Rule management
- `CommissionRecordController` - Record management
- `CommissionPayoutController` - Payout management
- **BUT**: No integration with sales rep dashboards

#### 5. **Unit Tests (Partial)** ⚠️
- `OrderItemCommissionCalculatorServiceTest`
- `CommissionRuleFinderServiceTest`
- Basic test coverage exists

### **What's Still Needed**

#### 1. **Provider Attribution System** ❌
- **Missing**: Link between providers (users) and sales reps who brought them
- **Needed**: 
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN acquired_by_rep_id BIGINT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN acquired_by_subrep_id BIGINT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN acquisition_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
  ```
- **Missing**: Provider-rep relationship tracking table

#### 2. **Commission Calculation Based on Provider Orders** ❌
- **Current**: Commission tied to `orders.sales_rep_id` (assumes rep creates orders)
- **Needed**: Commission based on who brought the provider
- **Missing**: Logic to track which rep gets commission when provider places order

#### 3. **Payment Status Integration** ❌
- **Current**: Commission calculated on order creation/status change
- **Needed**: Only calculate commissions when `payment_status = 'paid'`
- **Missing**: Payment date tracking for accurate commission timing

#### 4. **Sales Rep Dashboard** ❌
- **Missing**: Dashboard showing only paid commissions
- **Missing**: Provider management interface
- **Missing**: Team management for sub-reps
- **Missing**: Commission history views

#### 5. **Sub-Rep Dashboard** ❌
- **Missing**: Personal commission tracking
- **Missing**: Provider list management
- **Missing**: Training/onboarding tracking

#### 6. **Admin Sales Management** ❌
- **Missing**: Sales rep management interface
- **Missing**: Commission approval workflow
- **Missing**: Payout processing interface
- **Missing**: Sales team hierarchy visualization

#### 7. **Sub-Rep Invitation System** ❌
- **Missing**: Invitation table and workflow
- **Missing**: Email notifications
- **Missing**: Registration flow for invited sub-reps

#### 8. **Commission Approval Workflow** ❌
- **Current**: Basic status updates in CommissionController
- **Missing**: Multi-level approval (rep → admin)
- **Missing**: Audit trail for approvals
- **Missing**: Rejection reasons and notifications

#### 9. **Reporting & Analytics** ❌
- **Missing**: Commission reports by period
- **Missing**: Sales team performance metrics
- **Missing**: Provider acquisition tracking
- **Missing**: Revenue attribution reports

#### 10. **Background Jobs** ❌
- **Missing**: Automated commission calculation job
- **Missing**: Payout generation job
- **Missing**: Commission notification job

#### 11. **API Endpoints** ❌
- **Missing**: Sales rep dashboard API
- **Missing**: Sub-rep dashboard API
- **Missing**: Provider attribution API
- **Missing**: Team management API

#### 12. **Frontend Components** ❌

- **Missing**: Sales rep dashboard components
- **Missing**: Sub-rep dashboard components
- **Missing**: Admin sales management interface

### **Implementation Priority**

1. **Phase 1: Provider Attribution** (Critical)
   - Add provider-rep relationship tracking
   - Update commission calculation to use provider attribution

2. **Phase 2: Payment Integration** (Critical)
   - Only calculate commissions on paid orders
   - Add payment date tracking

3. **Phase 3: Sales Rep Dashboard** (High)
   - Core dashboard with paid commissions
   - Provider management
   - Basic team overview

4. **Phase 4: Sub-Rep System** (High)
   - Sub-rep dashboard
   - Invitation system
   - Parent/sub-rep relationship management

5. **Phase 5: Admin Interface** (Medium)
   - Sales team management
   - Commission approval workflow
   - Payout processing

6. **Phase 6: Automation** (Low)
   - Background jobs
   - Automated notifications
   - Reporting system

The commission engine has a solid foundation with all the core database structures and calculation logic in place. The main gap is the provider attribution system and the user interfaces for sales reps/sub-reps to actually use the system.
