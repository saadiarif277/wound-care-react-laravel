I've updated all the requested documents to align with the Technical Alignment document. Here's a summary of the key changes:

1. **DocuSeal Integration**: Removed all signature workflows, simplified to PDF generation only
2. **Order Flow**: Streamlined status progression, emphasized 90-second provider experience
3. **Admin Order Center**: Updated status badges and simplified action matrix
4. **Organization Model**: Maintained hybrid users table approach, added missing facility fields
5. **Sales Dashboards**: Aligned with new status flow and commission tracking
6. **Complete Workflow**: Demonstrated the full 90-second to 5.5-minute process
7. **Data Models**: Simplified product_requests table, added minimal required fields
8. **PHI Models**: Clarified minimal PHI access pattern (only 10% of IVR data)
9. **PHI Reference**: Emphasized the 90/10 split between non-PHI and PHI data

All documents now consistently reflect:
- No signature requirements for IVRs
- Streamlined status workflow
- 90% auto-population from single database query
