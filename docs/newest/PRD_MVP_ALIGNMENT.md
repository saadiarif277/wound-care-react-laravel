   - Provider/patient selection flow

### 🟢 Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
1. Bulk actions
2. Advanced filtering options
3. Export functionality
4. Enhanced accessibility features

## 📝 Key Implementation Achievements

The development team has made significant progress beyond the original MVP task list:

1. **UI/UX Excellence**: The dashboard and detail views are nearly complete with professional styling
2. **Status Workflow**: Fully implemented with proper state management
3. **IVR Integration**: DocuSeal integration is functional, just missing email delivery
4. **User Experience**: Collapsible sections, sticky headers, and responsive design all implemented

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Focus**: Implement email service (Laravel Mail + queue workers)
2. **Short-term**: Complete audit logging and document management
3. **Final Polish**: Add remaining filters and admin order creation

The core application is production-ready from a UI/workflow perspective. The main gap is backend services for email, audit trails, and document storage.
