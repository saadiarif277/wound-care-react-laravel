# MedLife amnio_amp_size Field Mapping Fix Summary

## Problem
The AI was not filling out the `amnio_amp_size` field for MedLife's IVR forms in DocuSeal, despite the field being present in the form data.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **AI Mapping Format Mismatch**: The AI service returned mappings in a nested format, but DocuSeal expected a simple key-value format
2. **Missing AI Foundry Configuration**: The Azure AI Foundry was not enabled in the environment configuration
3. **No Special Handling for MedLife Fields**: The AI mapping didn't have manufacturer-specific field handling

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed AI Mapping Result Format (DocuSealService.php)
```php
// Convert AI result format to simple key-value pairs
$mappedFields = [];
foreach ($aiResult['mappings'] as $targetField => $mapping) {
    if (isset($mapping['value'])) {
        $mappedFields[$targetField] = $mapping['value'];
    }
}
```

### 2. Added Special Handling for MedLife amnio_amp_size
```php
// Special handling for MedLife amnio_amp_size
if ($template->manufacturer && in_array($template->manufacturer->name, ['MedLife', 'MedLife Solutions'])) {
    // Check if amnio_amp_size is in the original data but not mapped
    if (isset($data['amnio_amp_size']) && !isset($mappedFields['amnio_amp_size'])) {
        $mappedFields['amnio_amp_size'] = $data['amnio_amp_size'];
        Log::info('Added MedLife amnio_amp_size field', [
            'value' => $data['amnio_amp_size']
        ]);
    }
}
```

### 3. Enabled Azure AI Foundry (.env)
```bash
AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENABLED=true
```

### 4. Existing Support in DocuSealFieldMapper.php
The field mapper already had special handling for MedLife fields (lines 169-177), ensuring the field is included when using the fallback mapping.

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to the Quick Request form
2. Select MedLife as the manufacturer
3. Fill out the form, including the product size (which maps to `amnio_amp_size`)
4. When the DocuSeal IVR loads, verify that the `amnio_amp_size` field is pre-filled

## Monitoring

Check the Laravel logs for:
- "ðŸ¤– Attempting AI-powered field mapping" - Indicates AI mapping is being attempted
- "âœ… AI field mapping successful" - AI mapping succeeded
- "Added MedLife amnio_amp_size field" - Special handling was triggered
- Field mapping details showing the amnio_amp_size field

## Files Modified

1. `/app/Services/DocuSealService.php` - Fixed AI mapping format and added MedLife handling
2. `/.env` - Added AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENABLED=true
3. `/database/migrations/2025_01_28_000006_add_ai_analysis_to_docuseal_templates.php` - Created migration for missing column

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures that even if the AI doesn't recognize the `amnio_amp_size` field, it will still be included in the mapping for MedLife forms
- The solution is backward compatible and won't affect other manufacturers
- The field mapping now properly converts the AI response format to what DocuSeal expects
