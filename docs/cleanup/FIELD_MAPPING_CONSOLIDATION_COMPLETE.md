## 🚀 New Management Tools

### Unified Command
```bash
php artisan field-mapping test              # Test system functionality
php artisan field-mapping map --episode=123 --manufacturer=ACZ
php artisan field-mapping analyze           # Performance analytics
php artisan field-mapping clean --dry-run   # Cleanup old data
php artisan field-mapping migrate --force   # Migrate legacy data
```

## 🔧 Service Provider Updates

Updated `AppServiceProvider.php`:
- ✅ Registered all unified services with proper dependency injection
- ✅ Removed old service bindings (OCR, deprecated services)
- ✅ Proper singleton registration for performance

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Caching Strategy
- **Data Extraction**: 5-minute cache for episode data
- **Field Matching**: Cache fuzzy match results
- **FHIR Integration**: Prevent duplicate API calls
- **Analytics**: Optimized database queries

### Fuzzy Matching Algorithms
- **Jaro-Winkler**: For string similarity
- **Levenshtein**: For edit distance
- **Semantic Matching**: For field aliases
- **Pattern Matching**: For field naming conventions

## 🛡️ Data Integrity

### Migration Strategy
- ✅ Old data preserved in backup tables
- ✅ Gradual migration with validation
- ✅ Rollback capability maintained
- ✅ Analytics populated from historical data

### Validation System
- **Field-level validation**: Type and format checking
- **Business rules**: Manufacturer-specific requirements  
- **Completeness tracking**: Required vs optional fields
- **Warning system**: Non-blocking validation issues
