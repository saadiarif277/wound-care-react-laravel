# Episode-Centric Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the QuickRequest module from a traditional step-by-step form into an Episode-Centric Workflow that prioritizes document upload and AI-powered form auto-filling.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. New Backend Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/QuickRequestEpisodeWithDocumentsController.php`

- **Episode Creation**: Creates `PatientManufacturerIVREpisode` records with document processing
- **FHIR Integration**: Automatically creates FHIR Patient resources via `PatientService`
- **Document Processing**: Handles file uploads and simulates AI/OCR extraction
- **Data Extraction**: Formats extracted data for form consumption
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with database transactions

### 2. Updated Frontend Component
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/QuickRequest/CreateNew.tsx`

- **New Step Structure**: Replaced "Context & Request" with "Create Episode & Upload"
- **Episode Validation**: Added episode_id validation before proceeding
- **Patient Name Sync**: Automatically syncs patient_name with first_name + last_name
- **Episode Status Display**: Shows episode creation status in UI
- **Callback Integration**: Handles episode creation callbacks

### 3. New Step1CreateEpisode Component
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/QuickRequest/Components/Step1CreateEpisode.tsx`

- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Modern file upload interface
- **Auto-Processing**: Automatically processes documents when context is complete
- **Real-time Status**: Shows processing status and extracted data
- **Provider Pre-selection**: Auto-selects provider for provider users
- **FHIR Patient Creation**: Creates Azure Health Data Services patient records
- **Form Auto-fill**: Populates form with extracted data

### 4. API Integration
**Route**: `POST /api/quick-request/create-episode-with-documents`

- **Multipart Support**: Handles file uploads with form data
- **Authentication**: Secured with `auth:sanctum` middleware
- **Validation**: Validates provider, facility, patient name, and documents
- **Response Format**: Returns episode_id, patient_fhir_id, and extracted_data

## Workflow Changes

### Before (Traditional)
1. Context & Request → 2. Patient & Insurance → 3. Clinical & Billing → 4. Product Selection → 5. Review & Submit → 6. Final Submission

### After (Episode-Centric)
1. **Create Episode & Upload** → 2. **Verify Patient & Insurance** → 3. **Verify Clinical & Billing** → 4. Select Products → 5. Review & Confirm → 6. Final Submission

## Key Benefits

### Speed & Efficiency
- **Document-First Approach**: Upload documents to auto-fill entire form
- **Reduced Manual Entry**: AI extraction minimizes typing
- **Faster Verification**: Steps become verification rather than initial entry
- **Episode Atomic Unit**: Provider + Facility + Patient + Documents in one operation

### Compliance & Integration
- **FHIR Compliance**: Immediate Patient resource creation in Azure Health Data Services
- **Episode Tracking**: Comprehensive audit trail from creation
- **PHI Handling**: Proper separation of PHI and operational data
- **Document Management**: Secure storage and processing of clinical documents

### User Experience
- **Visual Progress**: Real-time processing status updates
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works even if AI services fail
- **Modern UI**: Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- **Contextual Help**: Clear instructions and workflow explanation

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
PatientManufacturerIVREpisode {
  id: UUID (primary key)
  patient_id: string (FHIR ID)
  patient_fhir_id: string
  patient_display_id: string (human-readable)
  manufacturer_id: nullable (set during product selection)
  status: enum (draft, active, completed)
  ivr_status: enum (pending, processing, completed)
  metadata: JSON {
    provider_id, facility_id, request_type,
    patient_name, document_urls, extracted_data,
    created_from, workflow_version
  }
}
```

### FHIR Integration
- **Patient Resource**: Created immediately upon episode creation
- **Azure Health Data Services**: PHI stored in compliant environment
- **Referential Integrity**: Episode references FHIR patient_id

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Secure storage in `episodes/documents/`
2. **Processing**: AI/OCR extraction (currently simulated)
3. **Extraction**: Demographics, insurance, clinical data
4. **Formatting**: Structured data for form consumption
5. **Integration**: Auto-populate form fields

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements
1. **Real AI Integration**: Replace simulation with Azure Form Recognizer
2. **Advanced Extraction**: Support more document types and data fields
3. **Validation Engine**: Cross-reference extracted data with clinical rules
4. **Progress Tracking**: Enhanced status updates and progress indicators

### Phase 3 Expansion
1. **Bulk Processing**: Support multiple patient episodes
2. **Template Recognition**: Identify and optimize for common document formats
3. **Quality Scoring**: Confidence scores for extracted data
4. **Integration APIs**: Connect with EHR systems for document retrieval

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing
- Episode creation with various document types
- Form auto-fill verification
- Error handling scenarios
- FHIR patient resource validation

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for controller methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component testing
- Document processing pipeline tests

## Compliance Notes

### HIPAA Compliance
- PHI properly routed to Azure Health Data Services
- Document storage in secure, encrypted environment
- Audit trail for all PHI access and modifications
- Proper error handling without PHI exposure

### Healthcare Standards
- FHIR R4 compliance for patient resources
- MAC validation integration points maintained
- Clinical coding standards preserved
- Documentation requirements enforced

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Targets
- Document processing under 10 seconds
- Episode creation under 5 seconds
- Form auto-fill completion under 2 seconds
- UI responsiveness during processing

### Scaling Strategies
- Asynchronous document processing
- Caching for extracted data
- Background FHIR resource creation
- Progressive form updates

This Episode-Centric Workflow represents a significant advancement in clinical efficiency while maintaining strict healthcare compliance and security standards.
