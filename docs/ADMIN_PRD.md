MSC Platform ‚Äì Admin Order Processing Flow (PRD)

1. OVERVIEW
This document defines the product requirements for the Admin workflow after a Provider or Office Manager submits an order to the MSC platform. The Admin is responsible for reviewing and sending IVR and Order Forms to the manufacturer, updating statuses, uploading supporting documents, and notifying users as needed.
The platform should re-use shared UI templates for both the Order Dashboard and Order Details views across all user roles. Based on user permissions, each view should dynamically render applicable data fields and action buttons (e.g., status edits, uploads, DocuSeal send options).

8. COMPLIANCE & DELETE POLICY
Deleted orders should be soft deleted (is_deleted = true)
Only Admins can view soft-deleted records
PHI retained unless purged by policy
‚ö†Ô∏è Flag for Compliance Review:
Define retention duration
Legal/compliance risk of retaining canceled PHI

9. DISCUSSION: PLATFORM EMAIL VS DOCUSEAL
Current:
All documents sent via DocuSeal for e-signature and tracking
Proposal:
Option to send IVR and Order Form via MSC platform email
Manufacturer replies with verification and attachments
Pros:
Faster response time
Easier for manufacturers to reply
Easier ingestion of returned documents
Cons:
No audit trail
Potential PHI in replies
Requires secure email handling
Next Step:
Technical + compliance review to determine feasibility
DocuSeal remains fallback/default
