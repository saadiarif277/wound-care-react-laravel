- Changed from multi-select checkbox to single radio button selection
- Updated field from `wound_types` (array) to `wound_type` (string)
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Location: `DiagnosisCodeSelector.tsx` - integrated into diagnosis code selector

### 3. Prior Application Updates (✅ COMPLETED)
- Added conditional fields when prior applications > 0:
  - Product previously used (text field)
  - Checkbox for "Applied within the last 12 months"
- Location: `Step4ClinicalBilling.tsx` lines 500-537

### 4. Title Change (✅ COMPLETED)

### 5. Hospice Consent Fields (✅ COMPLETED)

- Location: `Step4ClinicalBilling.tsx` lines 699-728

### 6. Comprehensive Diagnosis Code Selector (✅ COMPLETED)
- Created new `DiagnosisCodeSelector` component with:
  - Wound type selection with visual indicators
  - Dual-coding logic for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers
  - Searchable dropdowns with real-time filtering
  - Dynamic code loading based on wound type
  - Validation and completion status
- Location: `resources/js/Components/DiagnosisCode/DiagnosisCodeSelector.tsx`

### 7. IVR Field Mapping (✅ COMPLETED)
- Updated `Step7DocuSealIVR.tsx` to include all new fields in DocuSeal data:
  - Wound duration (formatted and individual fields)
  - Diagnosis codes (with proper display formatting)
  - Prior application details
  - Hospice consent fields
- Location: `Step7DocuSealIVR.tsx` lines 178-248

### 8. Backend Validation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Updated `QuickRequestController.php` validation rules:
  - Support for single wound_type field
  - New diagnosis code fields (primary, secondary, single)
  - Duration field validation
  - Prior application fields
  - Hospice consent fields
  - Custom validation for duration and diagnosis codes
- Location: `app/Http/Controllers/QuickRequestController.php` lines 316-430

### 9. JavaScript/TypeScript Tests (✅ COMPLETED)
- Created comprehensive test suites:
  - `Step4ClinicalBilling.test.tsx` - Tests for all new form fields
  - `DiagnosisCodeSelector.test.tsx` - Tests for diagnosis code selector
  - `Step7DocuSealIVR.test.tsx` - Tests for IVR field mapping
- Location: Test files in respective component directories

## Key Features

### Diagnosis Code Logic
1. **Diabetic Foot Ulcer** - Requires dual coding:
   - Primary: Diabetes diagnosis (E-codes)
   - Secondary: Chronic ulcer location (L97-codes)

2. **Venous Leg Ulcer** - Requires dual coding:
   - Primary: Varicose vein diagnosis (I83-codes)
   - Secondary: Chronic ulcer severity (L97-codes)

3. **Other wound types** - Single diagnosis code required

### Field Dependencies
- Prior application product field only shows when prior applications > 0
- Hospice consent fields only show when hospice is selected
- Other wound type specification only shows when "Other" is selected

### Data Flow
1. User selects wound type in diagnosis code selector
2. Appropriate diagnosis code fields appear
3. All new fields are validated on form submission
4. Data is prepared for DocuSeal IVR with proper formatting
5. Backend validates all fields before creating the order

## Testing
All components have been tested with:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for form submission
- Validation tests for required fields
- Conditional field display tests

## Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- New fields are properly typed in TypeScript
- Validation messages are user-friendly
- IVR templates will need to be updated to include the new field mappings
