+ docuseal_folder_id  
+ manufacturer_delivery_status
+ documents_generated_at
+ docuseal_metadata
```

### API Endpoints
```bash
POST   /api/v1/admin/docuseal/generate-document         # Generate documents
GET    /api/v1/admin/docuseal/submissions/{id}/status   # Check status
GET    /api/v1/admin/docuseal/submissions/{id}/download # Download docs
GET    /api/v1/admin/docuseal/orders/{id}/submissions   # List submissions
