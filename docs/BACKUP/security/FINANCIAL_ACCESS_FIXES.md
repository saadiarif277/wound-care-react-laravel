# Financial Access Control Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **FinancialAccessControl Middleware Bug**
**Problem**: The middleware was checking `$user->role` but the User model has a relationship called `userRole`, not `role`.

**Fix**: Updated `app/Http/Middleware/FinancialAccessControl.php`:
- Changed `$user->role` to `$user->userRole`
- Added proper relationship loading with `$user->load('userRole')`
- Ensured the middleware properly validates role access

### 2. **Dashboard Controller Enhancement**
**Problem**: The dashboard was showing static dummy data instead of real role-filtered data.

**Fix**: Enhanced `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`:
- Added role-based dashboard routing
- Implemented proper financial data filtering based on user roles
- Added real data retrieval from database with role restrictions
- Created role-specific dashboard data methods

### 3. **Provider Dashboard Updates**
**Problem**: Dashboard was using static data and not respecting financial restrictions.

**Fix**: Updated `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard/Provider/ProviderDashboard.tsx`:
- Integrated with real dashboard data from controller
- Added proper financial data display based on role restrictions
- Implemented `OrderTotalDisplay` component for role-aware financial information
- Added debug information for development testing

### 4. **Office Manager Dashboard Updates**
**Problem**: Dashboard was showing financial data that should be restricted.

**Fix**: Updated `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard/OfficeManager/OfficeManagerDashboard.tsx`:
- Removed all financial data display for office managers
- Added clear financial restriction notices
- Ensured no pricing, discounts, or amounts owed are shown
- Added debug information for testing

### 5. **Product Catalog Financial Restrictions**
**Problem**: Product catalog was showing MSC pricing and financial data to all users without role restrictions.

**Fix**: Updated product catalog system:
- **ProductController**: Added role-based pricing data filtering in all API endpoints
- **Products/Index.tsx**: Integrated PricingDisplay component and role-aware UI
- **Products/Show.tsx**: Added financial restrictions to product detail pages
- **ProductSelector.tsx**: Updated to use consistent role-based pricing display
- **API Endpoints**: All product APIs now filter financial data based on user roles

### 6. **Route Protection**
**Problem**: Financial routes were not protected by the financial access middleware.

**Fix**: Updated `routes/web.php`:
- Applied `financial.access` middleware to commission routes
- Added test route for verifying role restrictions
- Ensured proper middleware protection for financial data

| Role | Financial Data | Discounts | MSC Pricing | Order Totals | Commission | Product Catalog |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Provider** | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Full Pricing |
| **Office Manager** | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | ‚ùå **National ASP Only** |
| **MSC Rep** | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full Pricing |
| **MSC Sub-Rep** | ‚ùå Limited | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | üü° Limited | üü° Limited Pricing |

## Key Components

### Backend Security
- **FinancialAccessControl Middleware**: Blocks financial routes for unauthorized roles
- **UserRole Model**: Defines financial access permissions per role
- **Dashboard Controller**: Filters data based on role restrictions
- **Product Controller**: Role-based pricing data filtering in all endpoints

### Frontend Security
- **PricingDisplay Component**: Shows only National ASP for office managers
- **OrderTotalDisplay Component**: Blocks financial totals for restricted roles
- **Role-aware Dashboards**: Different data and features per role
- **Product Catalog**: Consistent role-based pricing across all product views

### Testing Features
- **Debug Information**: Development-only panels showing role restrictions
- **Test Route**: `/test-role-restrictions` for verifying role permissions
- **Financial Restriction Notices**: Clear user communication about access limitations

## Expected Behavior

### For Healthcare Providers
- ‚úÖ See full financial information including amounts owed
- ‚úÖ View MSC pricing and discounts in product catalog
- ‚úÖ Access order totals and savings information
- ‚úÖ Complete pricing visibility in product catalogs and recommendations

### For Office Managers
- ‚ùå **NO financial data visible anywhere**
- ‚ùå **NO pricing information except National ASP in product catalog**
- ‚ùå **NO order totals or amounts owed**
- ‚ùå **NO discount information**
- ‚ùå **NO MSC pricing in product searches, recommendations, or catalog**
- ‚ùå **NO commission data**
- ‚úÖ Full access to clinical workflows and provider coordination
- ‚úÖ Clear notices explaining financial restrictions

## Product Catalog Specific Restrictions

### Office Manager Restrictions in Product Catalog:
1. **Product Index Page**: Only National ASP pricing shown, MSC pricing column hidden
2. **Product Detail Page**: MSC pricing, discounts, and savings hidden
3. **Product Search API**: MSC pricing data stripped from responses
4. **Product Recommendations**: Only National ASP pricing in AI recommendations
5. **Product Selector**: Consistent National ASP-only pricing display
6. **Size Pricing Tables**: MSC pricing and savings columns hidden

### Visual Indicators:
- **Yellow warning notices** explaining pricing restrictions
- **Consistent PricingDisplay component** usage across all product views
- **Role-aware table columns** that hide/show based on permissions
- **Financial restriction badges** in product cards and lists

## Verification Steps

1. **Login as Provider** (`provider@mscwound.com`):
   - Should see full financial data in dashboard
   - Should see MSC pricing in product catalog
   - Should see amounts owed and pricing information
   - Debug panel should show `Can View Financials: Yes`

2. **Login as Office Manager** (`office.manager@mscwound.com`):
   - Should NOT see any financial data in dashboard
   - Should ONLY see National ASP pricing in product catalog
   - Should see financial restriction notices
   - Debug panel should show `Can View Financials: No`

3. **Test Route**: Visit `/test-role-restrictions` while logged in to see role permissions

4. **Product Catalog Tests**:
   - Browse `/products` - Office managers should only see National ASP
   - View individual product pages - No MSC pricing for office managers
   - Use product search - API should filter pricing data
   - Test product recommendations - Only National ASP for office managers

## Security Implementation

- **Backend Enforcement**: All restrictions enforced at API/controller level
- **Middleware Protection**: Financial routes blocked by middleware
- **Component-Level Security**: Frontend components respect role restrictions
- **Data Sanitization**: Financial data stripped before sending to unauthorized roles
- **API Filtering**: All product endpoints filter pricing based on user role
- **Consistent UI**: PricingDisplay component ensures uniform pricing display

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Middleware/FinancialAccessControl.php` - Fixed role relationship bug
2. `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` - Enhanced with role-based data
3. `app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php` - **NEW**: Added role-based pricing filtering
4. `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard/Provider/ProviderDashboard.tsx` - Real data integration
5. `resources/js/Pages/Dashboard/OfficeManager/OfficeManagerDashboard.tsx` - Financial restrictions
6. `resources/js/Pages/Products/Index.tsx` - **NEW**: Role-aware product catalog
7. `resources/js/Pages/Products/Show.tsx` - **NEW**: Role-aware product details
8. `resources/js/Components/ProductCatalog/ProductSelector.tsx` - **NEW**: Consistent pricing display
9. `routes/web.php` - Added middleware protection and test routes

## API Endpoints Updated

1. `/api/products/search` - Now filters MSC pricing based on role
2. `/api/products/{id}` - Role-based financial data filtering
3. `/api/products` - Complete role-aware product data
4. `/products` - Role restrictions passed to frontend
5. `/products/{id}` - Role-aware product detail pages

The financial access control system now comprehensively restricts office managers from seeing any financial data across the entire application, including:
- **Dashboards**: No financial metrics or amounts owed
- **Product Catalog**: Only National ASP pricing visible
- **Product Search**: MSC pricing filtered from API responses
- **Product Recommendations**: Financial data restricted in AI suggestions
- **Product Details**: Complete financial information hidden

Office managers can still access all clinical workflows, provider coordination, and facility management features while being completely blocked from financial information.
