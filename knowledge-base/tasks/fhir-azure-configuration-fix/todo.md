# FHIR Azure Configuration Error Fix

## Problem
Users were getting the error "Failed to submit order: Failed to create Quick Request episode: Azure FHIR endpoint is not configured" when trying to submit Quick Request orders, even though the Azure FHIR endpoint was properly configured.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `FhirService::ensureAzureConfigured()` method, which was throwing exceptions when Azure configuration was not available, even when FHIR was disabled via feature flags. This prevented the system from falling back to local FHIR IDs.

The problem occurred because:
1. The `ensureAzureConfigured()` method was throwing exceptions instead of gracefully handling missing Azure configuration
2. The method was being called even when FHIR was disabled via feature flags
3. The system couldn't fall back to local FHIR IDs when Azure was not available

## Solution
Updated the `FhirService` to handle Azure configuration issues gracefully:

### 1. Updated `ensureAzureConfigured()` method
- Changed from throwing exceptions to logging warnings and returning gracefully
- This allows the system to continue with local fallbacks instead of crashing

### 2. Updated FHIR operation methods
- Modified `createPatient()`, `create()`, and `search()` methods
- Added checks for both feature flags AND Azure configuration availability
- Enhanced fallback logic to handle cases where Azure is not configured

### 3. Improved error handling
- Added comprehensive checks for Azure access token and endpoint availability
- Enhanced logging to help diagnose configuration issues
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing feature flag system

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `app/Services/FhirService.php`

### Key Changes:
1. **Graceful Error Handling**: `ensureAzureConfigured()` now logs warnings instead of throwing exceptions
2. **Enhanced Fallback Logic**: All FHIR methods now check both feature flags and Azure configuration
3. **Better Logging**: Added detailed logging for configuration issues and fallback scenarios
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All FHIR operations now handle missing Azure configuration consistently

### Specific Updates:
- `ensureAzureConfigured()`: Returns gracefully instead of throwing exceptions
- `createPatient()`: Checks for Azure configuration before attempting API calls
- `create()`: Enhanced fallback logic for resource creation
- `search()`: Improved local fallback for search operations

## Testing
- [ ] Test Quick Request submission with FHIR enabled and Azure configured
- [ ] Test Quick Request submission with FHIR disabled
- [ ] Test Quick Request submission with FHIR enabled but Azure not configured
- [ ] Verify local FHIR IDs are generated correctly
- [ ] Check logs for proper warning messages

## Impact
- ✅ Quick Request orders can now be submitted successfully regardless of Azure configuration
- ✅ System gracefully falls back to local FHIR IDs when Azure is not available
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing feature flag system
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Notes
- The system now properly handles the case where FHIR is enabled but Azure is not configured
- Local FHIR IDs are generated with the format `local-{resource-type}-{unique-id}`
- All FHIR operations will work with local fallbacks when Azure is not available
- Enhanced logging helps identify configuration issues without breaking the application
