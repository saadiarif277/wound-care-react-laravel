- Intelligent form completion

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Build intelligent command system
- [ ] Add predictive assistance
- [ ] Enhance voice recognition for medical terms
- [ ] Implement workflow shortcuts
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Create continuous conversation mode

#### Deliverables  
- Natural language commands
- Proactive AI suggestions
- Medical vocabulary support

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Weeks 7-8)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Integrate with FHIR data access
- [ ] Connect to order management
- [ ] Add Medicare validation assistance
- [ ] Implement response caching
- [ ] Add WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Ensure PHI compliance
- [ ] Create audit logging

#### Deliverables
- Full system integration
- Optimized performance
- Security compliance

## Key Components to Build/Enhance

### 1. AIService.ts
```typescript
interface AIService {
  sendMessage(message: string, context: Context): Promise<Response>
  streamResponse(message: string): AsyncGenerator<string>
  getCommands(): AICommand[]
}
```

### 2. ContextManager.ts  
```typescript
interface ContextManager {
  getCurrentPage(): PageContext
  getUserRole(): UserRole
  getPatientContext(): PatientContext
  getRecentActions(): Action[]
}
```

### 3. WorkflowEngine.ts
```typescript
interface WorkflowEngine {
  startWorkflow(type: WorkflowType): void
  getCurrentStep(): WorkflowStep
  completeStep(data: any): void
  getGuidance(): string
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Components
- **AIOverlay.tsx**: Real AI integration, streaming responses
- **VoiceAssistant.tsx**: Superinterface integration, medical vocabulary
- **FormAssistant.tsx**: Smart form filling with voice
- **ClinicalNotesAssistant.tsx**: Medical dictation and formatting
- **ContextualHelper.tsx**: Page-specific assistance

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Gains
- 50% reduction in form completion time
- 70% voice command success rate
- 30% fewer support escalations

### Clinical Accuracy  
- 95% medical term recognition accuracy
- 90% correct product recommendations
- 100% PHI compliance maintained

### Performance Targets
- <500ms AI response time
- <100ms voice recognition
- 99.9% system uptime

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "superinterface": "^latest",
  "@superinterface/react": "^latest",
  "openai": "^4.0.0",
  "@radix-ui/themes": "^latest"
}
```

### API Endpoints Needed
- `/api/ai/chat` - AI conversation endpoint
- `/api/ai/commands` - Command processing
- `/api/ai/context` - Context management
- `/api/workflows/*` - Workflow endpoints

### Security Considerations
- PHI-safe AI processing
- Encrypted communication
- Role-based AI access
- Audit trail for all interactions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Implement fallback to text input
- Add offline mode with cached responses
- Ensure graceful degradation

### Compliance Risks  
- Use PHI-compliant AI services
- Maintain audit logs
- Clear AI/human handoff protocols

### User Adoption
- Progressive feature rollout
- In-app training mode
- Clear value demonstrations

## Review

This plan transforms the GhostAiUi from a prototype into a powerful AI assistant that:
1. Provides real AI-powered assistance
2. Integrates deeply with clinical workflows
3. Offers advanced voice capabilities
4. Maintains security and compliance
5. Significantly improves user efficiency

The phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining system stability and allowing for user feedback integration.
