# MUE Data Protection Implementation

## Overview
This task involved securing MUE (Maximum Units of Eligibility) data to ensure it's only visible to administrators while maintaining validation functionality for all users.

## Todo Items

### ✅ 1. Remove MUE from product catalog views for providers
- Updated ProductController::index() to exclude MUE data from the product listing
- Modified the paginated response to properly extract array data for the frontend

### ✅ 2. Ensure MUE is only shown in admin views  
- Updated ProductController::search() to conditionally include MUE only for users with 'manage-products' permission
- Modified ProductController::apiShow() to exclude MUE for non-admin users
- Protected Product Create/Edit views which are already restricted to admin users via middleware

### ✅ 3. Update API responses to exclude MUE for non-admin users
- Updated ProductController::filterProductPricingData() to handle MUE visibility based on permissions
- Modified ConfigurationController::getProductMueLimits() to return 403 for non-admin users
- Updated ConfigurationController::getQuickRequestConfig() to conditionally include MUE limits
- Modified ProductController::validateQuantity() to not expose actual MUE values to non-admins

### ✅ 4. Keep MUE validation warnings in order selection
- Backend validation through Product::validateOrderQuantity() continues to work
- Updated frontend ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx to remove client-side MUE checks
- Validation errors are still shown when MUE limits are exceeded, without revealing the actual limit

### ✅ 5. Fix product catalog display for providers
- Fixed "products.filter is not a function" error in ProductController::index()
- Changed from passing paginated object to extracting array data with ->items()

## Technical Changes

### Backend Files Modified:
1. `/app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`
   - Updated search(), filterProductPricingData(), validateQuantity() methods
   - Fixed index() method to properly pass array data

2. `/app/Http/Controllers/ConfigurationController.php`
   - Added permission check to getProductMueLimits()
   - Updated getQuickRequestConfig() to conditionally include MUE

### Frontend Files Modified:
1. `/resources/js/Components/ProductCatalog/ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx`
   - Removed client-side MUE validation logic
   - Added comments explaining server-side validation approach

## Security Improvements
- MUE data is now treated as sensitive CMS information
- Only administrators with 'manage-products' permission can view MUE values
- Providers receive validation warnings without seeing actual limits
- System maintains HIPAA compliance while protecting pricing data

## Review Summary
The implementation successfully balances security requirements with functional needs. MUE limits are enforced during order validation while keeping the actual values hidden from non-administrative users. The fix for the product catalog ensures providers can browse products without encountering JavaScript errors.
