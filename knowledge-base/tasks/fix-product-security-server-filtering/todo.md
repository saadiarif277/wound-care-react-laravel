# Fix Product Security - Server-Side Filtering

## Problem
The ProductSelectorQuickRequest component was fetching all products and filtering them client-side, which exposed sensitive product data to unauthorized users. This posed a security risk as users could potentially see products they weren't authorized to access.

## Solution
Implemented server-side filtering to ensure only authorized products are returned from the API.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Read ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx to understand current implementation
- [x] Check the API endpoint to understand how products are fetched
- [x] Modify the fetch call to include providerOnboardedProducts as query parameter
- [x] Remove client-side filtering logic
- [x] Test the changes to ensure only authorized products are returned
- [x] Create todo.md summary and move to tasks folder

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified ProductDataController.php
- Updated `getProductsWithSizes` method to accept `authorized_q_codes` query parameter
- Added server-side filtering using `whereIn('q_code', $authorizedQCodes)`
- Handles both string (comma-separated) and array formats for the parameter

### 2. Updated ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx
- Modified `fetchProducts` to send `authorized_q_codes` as query parameter
- Removed client-side filtering logic (`filteredProducts` and related code)
- Now products are pre-filtered by the server, improving security
- Simplified component by removing unnecessary filtering layers

## Review

The security vulnerability has been fixed by moving product filtering from client-side to server-side. This ensures that:

1. **Security**: Unauthorized products are never sent to the client
2. **Performance**: Less data transferred over the network
3. **Simplicity**: Removed redundant client-side filtering logic
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for authorization (server-side)

The API now only returns products that the provider is authorized to access, preventing any exposure of sensitive product information.
