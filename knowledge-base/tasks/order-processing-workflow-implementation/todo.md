# MSC Platform Order Processing Workflow Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses the implementation of the complete order processing workflow where Providers/Office Managers create and review orders with IVR pre-generation before submission, followed by dual notifications and Admin-managed manufacturer communications via DocuSeal.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- **Basic Infrastructure**: QuickRequestController, Order/ProductRequest models, DocuSeal integration
- **FHIR Integration**: PHI data properly separated in Azure FHIR
- **Role-Based Access**: Basic RBAC system with permissions
- **DocuSeal Service**: Full API integration for form generation and submission
- **Notification Framework**: Basic email notification system exists

### ‚ùå **Critical Gaps Identified:**

1. **IVR Timing Issue**: IVR is generated AFTER submission, but requirement is BEFORE submission during order review
2. **Missing Dual Notifications**: Only basic notifications exist, need both Provider/OM AND Admin notifications
3. **Financial Data Exposure**: Office Managers can currently see ASP and Amount to be Billed (should be hidden)
4. **No Pre-submission Review**: Missing order review page with consent checkbox
5. **Limited Provider Access**: No deep link system for Provider/OM to track order progress
6. **Edit Restrictions**: No proper edit controls based on submission status

## Key Implementation Requirements

### 1. **IVR Pre-Generation Workflow**
```php
// New workflow sequence:
// 1. Provider/OM completes order form
// 2. System generates IVR during order review (NOT after submission)
// 3. Provider/OM reviews IVR and order details
// 4. Provider/OM provides consent
// 5. Order is submitted with completed IVR
// 6. Dual notifications sent
// 7. Admin manages manufacturer communication
```

### 2. **Financial Data Visibility Matrix**
| User Role | ASP Total | Amount to be Billed | Product Info |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Provider | ‚úÖ Visible | ‚úÖ Visible | ‚úÖ Visible |
| Office Manager | ‚ùå HIDDEN | ‚ùå HIDDEN | ‚úÖ Visible |
| Admin | ‚úÖ Visible | ‚úÖ Visible | ‚úÖ Visible |

### 3. **Notification Flow**
```
Order Submission Trigger
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Provider/OM Notification (Confirmation + Deep Link)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin Notification (New Order Alert + Management Link)

Status Updates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Provider/OM (Status Change Notifications)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin (Action Required Notifications)
```

### 4. **Edit Permission Matrix**
| Order Status | Provider/OM Edit | Admin Edit | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Draft | ‚úÖ Full Edit | ‚úÖ Full Edit | Pre-submission |
| Pending | ‚ùå Read Only | ‚úÖ Full Edit | Post-submission |
| Submitted | ‚ùå Read Only | ‚úÖ Status Only | Manufacturer review |
| Approved | ‚ùå Read Only | ‚úÖ Status Only | Final state |

### 5. **Deep Link Structure**
```
Provider/OM Links:
- /orders/{orderId}/track?token={secureToken}
- Read-only access to order details and status
- Financial data filtered based on role

Admin Links:
- /admin/orders/{orderId}
- Full management capabilities
- Manufacturer communication tools
```

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. **PHI Compliance**
- All patient data remains in Azure FHIR
- No PHI stored in operational database
- Proper audit logging for all PHI access

### 2. **Financial Data Security**
- Office Managers CANNOT see financial data at any point
- Audit all financial data access attempts
- Role-based middleware enforcement

### 3. **Workflow Integrity**
- IVR MUST be generated before submission
- Both Provider/OM AND Admin must receive notifications
- Order edit permissions strictly enforced by status

### 4. **User Experience**
- Simple, intuitive order review process
- Clear consent mechanism
- Real-time status updates
- Easy navigation between workflow steps

## Questions for Clarification

1. **IVR Template Selection**: Should the IVR template be selected automatically based on manufacturer/product, or should the Provider/OM have a choice?

2. **Edit Restrictions**: After submission, should Providers be able to add notes/comments, or is it completely read-only?

3. **Notification Frequency**: How often should status update notifications be sent to Provider/OM (immediate, daily digest, on major changes only)?

4. **Deep Link Security**: What level of security do you want for the deep links (time-based expiration, IP restrictions, etc.)?

5. **Financial Data Audit**: Do you need real-time alerts when someone attempts to access financial data inappropriately?

6. **Manufacturer Response**: How should the system handle manufacturer rejections or requests for additional information?

## Next Steps

Once you approve this plan, I will:

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Implement core backend workflow changes
2. **Update TodoWrite**: Mark tasks as completed and move to next phase
3. **Provide Progress Updates**: High-level explanation of changes after each task
4. **Test Each Component**: Ensure each change works before moving to next task
5. **Maintain Simplicity**: Make minimal, focused changes to avoid complexity

Would you like me to proceed with this plan, or do you have questions about any specific aspects?
