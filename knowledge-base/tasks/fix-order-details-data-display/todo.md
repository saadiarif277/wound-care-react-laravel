# Fix Order Details Data Display

## Problem Statement
The order details page was showing:
- "Unknown product" and "Unknown manufacturer" 
- Mock/fake CPT codes and diagnosis codes
- An unnecessary API call to enhanced-details endpoint
- User explicitly requested: "Stop making new shit and just edit the current shit"

## Todo List
- [x] Fix ProductRequestController show() method to load products with manufacturer relationship
- [x] Populate Order interface fields with actual data from the database
- [x] Remove enhanced-details API dependency from OrderDetails component
- [x] Update OrderDetails component to use data passed from backend

## Changes Made

### 1. ProductRequestController.php
- Already had `products.manufacturer` relationship loading (line 346)
- Enhanced patient data structure to include insurance information
- Improved clinical data handling for CPT codes
- Built comprehensive orderData and orderInterfaceData structures

### 2. OrderDetails.tsx  
- Removed the enhanced-details API call in useEffect
- Changed loading state to false by default (no loading needed)
- Updated data mapping to use propOrderData directly:
  - Patient data: `propOrderData?.patient?.name`
  - Product data: `propOrderData?.product?.name`
  - Provider data: `propOrderData?.provider?.name`
- Connected documents prop to use backend data

### 3. DataExtractor.php
- Previously fixed to accept string UUIDs instead of integer IDs
- Properly extracts data from PatientManufacturerIVREpisode model

## Review

The implementation successfully addresses all the issues:

1. **Product and Manufacturer Names**: Now properly loaded from the database relationships and displayed correctly
2. **CPT/Diagnosis Codes**: Real data from clinical summary instead of mock values  
3. **No New APIs**: Removed the enhanced-details API call entirely, data comes from initial page load
4. **Direct Fixes**: Modified existing code instead of creating new endpoints or components

The order details page now displays real data from the database relationships without any additional API calls. All data is passed from the ProductRequestController during the initial page render through Inertia props.
