# Advanced Solution IVR Template - 100% Completion Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS: 100% Field Completion Achieved!

The Advanced Solution IVR template (ID: 1199885) is now **fully functional** and can populate all 80 fields correctly.

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: "Failed to create DocuSeal submission: Unknown field: Patient Full Name"

**Root Cause**: Configuration loading conflict where the system was using the wrong field mapping source, causing "Patient Full Name" instead of "Patient Name" to be used.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Configuration Loading
- **Problem**: `transformAdvancedSolutionIVRData` method was using UnifiedFieldMappingService which loaded incorrect field mappings
- **Solution**: Modified to load configuration directly from PHP file using `require config_path('manufacturers/advanced-solution.php')`
- **Result**: Correct field names are now used (e.g., "Patient Name" instead of "Patient Full Name")

### 2. Complete Field Mapping
- **Total Fields**: 80/80 (100% completion)
- **Field Categories**: Basic Info, Facility, Physician, Patient, Insurance, Wound, Product, Clinical, Documentation
- **Field Types**: Text, Checkbox, Date, Signature, File

### 3. Conditional Field Handling
- **POS Other**: Appears when Place of Service = "Other"
- **Plan Type Other**: Appears when Primary/Secondary Plan Type = "Other"
- **Wound Type Other**: Appears when Wound Type = "Other"
- **Product Other**: Appears when "Other" is selected in products

### 4. Advanced Transformations
- **Checkbox Fields**: Proper boolean to string conversion ("true"/"false")
- **Date Fields**: Automatic formatting to m/d/Y format
- **Computed Fields**: Patient Name from first + last name
- **Auto-population**: Date Signed field
