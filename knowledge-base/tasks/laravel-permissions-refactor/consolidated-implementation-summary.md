# Consolidated Permission System & Product Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Successfully consolidated all permission-related migrations and implemented comprehensive product filtering based on provider onboarding status.

## üéØ Requirements Implemented

### 1. Office Managers - Zero Financial Data Access ‚úÖ
- **Removed ALL financial permissions** from office-manager role
- **Permissions removed**: `view-national-asp`, `view-financials`, `view-msc-pricing`, `view-discounts`, `view-order-totals`, `view-commission`, `view-payouts`, `manage-financials`, `manage-commission`, `manage-payments`
- **Frontend updated** to use permission-based checks instead of role-based checks
- **Backend services** updated to use permission-based filtering

### 2. MUE Data - Admin Only Access ‚úÖ
- **MUE access** restricted to `manage-products` permission
- **Only admins** (admin, super-admin, msc-admin) have `manage-products` permission
- **Providers and office managers** cannot access MUE data
- **Backend validation** ensures only authorized users see MUE values

### 3. Provider Self-Only Orders ‚úÖ
- **Backend validation** added to `QuickRequestSubmitOrderRequest.php`
- **Providers can only create orders for themselves** - validation fails if `provider_id` != authenticated user ID
- **Frontend logic** updated in `QuickRequestService.php` to only show provider's own ID in dropdown
- **Database constraint** ensures `provider_id` is always the authenticated provider for provider role

### 4. Product Filtering by Onboarding Status ‚úÖ
- **Providers see only onboarded products** - filtered by active onboarding status in `provider_products` table
- **Office managers see products for selected provider** - when they select a provider, they see that provider's onboarded products
- **API endpoint** `/api/v1/providers/{id}/onboarded-products` returns Q-codes for filtering
- **Frontend filtering** implemented in `ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Migration Consolidation
**Created**: `2025_07_04_101526_consolidated_permission_system_update.php`
**Removed**: `2025_07_04_095839_remove_financial_permissions_from_office_managers.php` (redundant)

The consolidated migration:
1. Removes financial permissions from office managers
2. Configures provider permissions (clinical only)
3. Ensures admin permissions (full access)
4. Creates missing permissions for product management
5. Logs all changes for audit purposes

### Backend Changes

#### Permission System
- **Database**: Role-permission relationships updated via migration
- **Seeder**: `DatabaseSeeder.php` updated to reflect new permission structure
- **Services**: `ProductDataService.php` uses permission-based checks
- **Validation**: `QuickRequestSubmitOrderRequest.php` validates provider self-only orders

#### Product Filtering
- **Repository**: `ProductRepository::getProviderProducts()` filters by onboarded Q-codes
- **API**: `ProviderProductController` provides onboarded products endpoint
- **Models**: `Product` model has `activeProviders()` relationship for filtering

### Frontend Changes

#### Permission Hook
- **Updated**: `usePermissions.ts` with comprehensive financial access checks
- **Removed**: Hard-coded role restrictions from all components
- **Added**: Permission-based rendering logic

#### Components Updated
- `Step5ProductSelection.tsx` - Improved provider product fetching and error handling
- `ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx` - Filters products by onboarded Q-codes
- `ProtectedFinancialInfo.tsx` - Uses permissions instead of roles
- `Orders/Index.tsx` - Permission-based financial data visibility

## üß™ Testing Results

### Permission Verification ‚úÖ
```
OFFICE MANAGER (Jane Manager):
  ‚úÖ view-national-asp: NO
  ‚úÖ view-financials: NO  
  ‚úÖ view-msc-pricing: NO
  ‚úÖ view-commission: NO
  ‚úÖ manage-products (MUE): NO

PROVIDER (John Smith):
  ‚úÖ view-national-asp: YES (for clinical decisions)
  ‚úÖ view-products: YES
  ‚úÖ create-product-requests: YES
  ‚úÖ view-msc-pricing: NO
  ‚úÖ view-commission: NO
  ‚úÖ manage-products (MUE): NO

ADMIN (RV CTO):
  ‚úÖ manage-products (MUE): YES
  ‚úÖ view-financials: YES
  ‚úÖ view-msc-pricing: YES
  ‚úÖ manage-orders: YES
```

### Product Filtering Verification ‚úÖ
```
PROVIDER: John Smith (ID: 3)
  Onboarded Products: 2
  Q-Codes: Q4250, Q4303
  Product Names: Amnio AMP, Complete AA
  Products via Repository: 2
  API Response: {"success": true, "q_codes": ["Q4250", "Q4303"]}
```

## üîí Security Improvements

### Data Access Control
1. **Office Managers**: Cannot see any financial data (pricing, commissions, discounts)
2. **Providers**: Can see National ASP for clinical decisions but no other financial data
3. **MUE Access**: Restricted to admins only via `manage-products` permission
4. **Product Visibility**: Filtered by onboarding status to prevent unauthorized product access

### Order Creation Control
1. **Provider Validation**: Backend validates providers can only create orders for themselves
2. **Frontend Restriction**: Provider dropdown only shows self for provider role
3. **Office Manager Scope**: Can create orders for any provider in their organization

### Permission Architecture
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Database permissions only, no hard-coded role logic
2. **Permission-Based Rendering**: All frontend components use permission checks
3. **Granular Control**: Specific permissions for each type of access
4. **Audit Logging**: All permission changes logged for compliance

## üìã User Experience

### Providers
- See only products they are onboarded for
- Cannot access financial data beyond National ASP
- Can only create orders for themselves
- Clear messaging when no onboarded products exist

### Office Managers  
- Cannot see any financial information
- Can create orders for providers in their organization
- See products based on selected provider's onboarding status
- Clear messaging to select provider before viewing products

### Admins
- Full access to all data including MUE
- Can manage all aspects of the system
- Access to financial data and commission information

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved

1. **Security**: Eliminated financial data exposure to office managers
2. **Compliance**: MUE data properly restricted to authorized personnel
3. **Data Integrity**: Providers can only order products they're onboarded for
4. **Maintainability**: Permission changes via database, no code deployments needed
5. **Performance**: Efficient filtering at database level
6. **User Experience**: Clear messaging and appropriate access levels
