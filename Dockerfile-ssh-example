# Example Dockerfile with SSH support for GitHub
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install SSH client and git
RUN apk add --no-cache openssh-client git

# Create SSH directory
RUN mkdir -p /root/.ssh

# Set proper permissions for SSH
RUN chmod 700 /root/.ssh

# Add GitHub to known hosts to avoid SSH prompts
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (for better Docker layer caching)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
