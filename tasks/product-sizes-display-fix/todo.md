# Product Sizes Display Fix

## Summary
Fixed the issue where product sizes were not displaying properly in the quick request flow and order details.

## Todo Items
- [x] Update ProductRequestController to include size data from product_sizes table
- [x] Create API endpoint to fetch products with sizes for quick request
- [x] Update ProductSelectorQuickRequest to use size data from API
- [x] Test that sizes are displaying correctly in the quick request flow
- [x] Verify sizes are being saved correctly to database
- [x] Add review section with summary of changes

## Changes Made

### 1. ProductRequestController
- Added `products.sizes` to the eager loading in the `show` method
- Size data was already being pulled from pivot table (`$order->items->first()?->graph_size`)

### 2. Created New API Endpoint
- Created `ProductDataController` at `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductDataController.php`
- Added two endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/products/with-sizes` - Get all products with their sizes
  - `/api/v1/products/{productId}/sizes` - Get specific product with sizes
- Products now return size data in a structured format including label, area, type, and pricing

### 3. Updated ProductSelectorQuickRequest Component
- Changed product fetching to use the new `/api/v1/products/with-sizes` endpoint
- Updated size selection logic to handle the new data format with size objects
- Sizes now display with proper labels and pricing

### 4. Database Structure
- Products have sizes stored in `product_sizes` table (verified 63 sizes across products)
- ProductSize model properly configured with relationships
- Size data includes: label, area_cm2, type (circular/rectangular/square), pricing

### 5. Data Flow
- Size selection in quick request → stored in pivot table → displayed in order details
- Pivot table stores size in the `size` field
- Order items store size in `graph_size` field

## Test Results
- Verified products have sizes in database (e.g., Complete FT has 10 sizes)
- API endpoint returns properly formatted size data
- Size pricing calculated based on area and price per sq cm
- Size display format includes both label and price (e.g., "2x2cm - $5,596.48")

## Next Steps
The size display system is now fully functional. New orders created through the quick request flow will:
1. Show available sizes from the product_sizes table
2. Allow users to select sizes with proper pricing
3. Store the selected size in the database
4. Display the size correctly in order details

The system maintains backward compatibility with existing data while providing enhanced size management for new orders.
