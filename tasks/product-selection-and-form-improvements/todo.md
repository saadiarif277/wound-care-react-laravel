**Tasks:**
- [x] Parse CSV data from wound care diagnosis codes
- [x] Parse markdown data from traumatic/surgical/articular wound codes
- [x] Create consolidated diagnosis codes database integration
- [x] Implement searchable diagnosis code field via API
- [x] Add database seeder for 921 unique diagnosis codes
- [x] Test search functionality with various code patterns

### 5. Diagnosis Code Component Implementation ‚úÖ
**Files:**
- `/resources/js/Components/DiagnosisCode/DiagnosisCodeSelector.tsx`
- `/resources/js/Pages/QuickRequest/Components/Step2PatientInsurance.tsx`
- `/resources/js/Pages/QuickRequest/Components/Step4ClinicalBilling.tsx`

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create searchable diagnosis code input component
- [x] Implement fuzzy search for codes and descriptions
- [x] Add dual-coding support for wound types that require two codes
- [x] Show wound type selection buttons with visual indicators
- [x] Implement validation for both primary and secondary codes
- [x] Update form data structure for dual diagnosis codes
- [x] Test diagnosis code selection workflow for both single and dual coding

### 6. Additional Improvements Completed ‚úÖ

#### CSRF Token Security Fix
- [x] Fixed CSRF token expiration causing redirects to Step 1
- [x] Added retry logic with up to 2 attempts for CSRF failures
- [x] Implemented automatic token refresh every 10 minutes
- [x] Added token refresh before step transitions and FHIR operations

#### Component Placement Optimization
- [x] Removed DiagnosisCodeSelector from Step 2 (Patient Insurance)
- [x] Kept DiagnosisCodeSelector only on Step 4 (Clinical Billing)
- [x] Added clear wound type selection buttons

#### Clinical Validation Enhancement
- [x] Fixed expected service date auto-populating with tomorrow's date
- [x] Changed to start empty, forcing manual date entry

#### Database Integration
- [x] Enhanced DiagnosisCodesFromCsvSeeder to parse markdown files
- [x] Successfully imported 921 unique diagnosis codes
- [x] Implemented proper dual-coding categorization:
  - Yellow codes: E codes (diabetes), I codes (venous conditions)
  - Orange codes: L97/L98 codes (wound locations)
  - Pressure ulcer codes: L89 codes (single coding)

## Implementation Details

### Product ASP Sorting
```php
// ProductController.php and QuickRequestController.php
$query->orderBy('price_per_sq_cm', 'desc'); // Highest ASP first
```

### Size Selection Data
```typescript
// SizeManager component with grid layout
<div className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-2">
  {sizes.map(size => (
    <SizeQuantityControl key={size} size={size} />
  ))}
</div>
```

### Document Types
```typescript
export type DocumentType = 'demographics' | 'insurance_card' | 'clinical_notes' | 'other';
```

### Diagnosis Codes Database Structure
```sql
-- 921 unique diagnosis codes imported
-- Categories: yellow, orange, pressure_ulcer, chronic_ulcer_generic
-- Proper dual-coding support for venous and diabetic ulcers
```

### Wound Type Selection
```typescript
// Four clear wound type buttons with visual indicators
const WOUND_CARE_GROUPS = {
  venous_leg_ulcer: { requiresDualCoding: true },
  diabetic_foot_ulcer: { requiresDualCoding: true },
  pressure_ulcer: { requiresDualCoding: false },
  chronic_skin_subs: { requiresDualCoding: false }
}
```
