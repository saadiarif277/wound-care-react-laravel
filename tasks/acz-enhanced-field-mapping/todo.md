# ACZ Enhanced Field Mapping Engine

## Problem Analysis

### Current State
- ACZ & Associates has a comprehensive DocuSeal IVR form with 40+ fields
- Current field mapping engine can fill some fields but misses many opportunities
- Form includes complex radio button fields, conditional logic, and multiple data sources
- Need to enhance the filling engine to populate most fields automatically

### ACZ Form Structure Analysis
From the DocuSeal template (ID: 852440), the form includes:

1. **Product Selection** - Radio buttons with Q codes (Q4205, Q4290, Q4344, Q4275, Q4341, Q4313, Q4316, Q4164, Q4289)
2. **Representative Info** - Sales Rep, ISO, Additional Emails
3. **Physician Info** - Name, NPI, Specialty, Tax ID, PTAN, Medicaid, Phone, Fax, Organization
4. **Facility Info** - Similar fields as physician
5. **Place of Service** - Radio buttons (POS 11, POS 22, POS 24, POS 12, POS 32, Other)
6. **Patient Info** - Name, DOB, Address, Phone, Email, Caregiver
7. **Insurance Info** - Primary/Secondary names, policy numbers, payer phones
8. **Network Status** - In-Network/Out-of-Network radio buttons
9. **Authorization Questions** - Yes/No radio buttons for various conditions
10. **Clinical Info** - Wound location, ICD-10 codes, wound size, medical history

## Tasks
