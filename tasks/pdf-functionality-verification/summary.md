# PDF Template Management System - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Primary Issue: File Upload
- **Problem**: File uploads were failing with "Please select a PDF file to upload" despite file being selected
- **Root Cause**: Inertia.js form.post() wasn't properly handling File objects with FormData
- **Solution**: Changed to direct fetch API call with manual FormData construction
- **Result**: User confirmed successful upload: "okay I got one uploaded awesome!"
