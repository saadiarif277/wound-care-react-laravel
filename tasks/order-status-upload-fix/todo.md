# Order Status Upload and File Upload Fix

## Objective
Fix the file upload functionality in the Status Upload modal and ensure order status updates work properly with file uploads.

## Issues Identified

1. **File Upload Not Working**: The `handleStatusUpdate` function in `IVRDocumentSection.tsx` is not sending the file data to the backend
2. **Status Update Not Working**: The status update is not properly handling the file uploads from the modal

## Changes Made

### Frontend (IVRDocumentSection.tsx)
1. **Fixed handleStatusUpdate**: Updated to properly handle file uploads using FormData
2. **Added file handling**: Now includes both status documents and notification documents in the request
3. **Added shipping info display**: Shows shipping information for both submitted and confirmed orders
4. **Updated OrderFormData interface**: Added shippingInfo property to support shipping data display
5. **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and user feedback

### Backend (OrderCenterController.php)
1. **Fixed order form status update**: Changed from updating `order_status` to `order_form_status` field
2. **Fixed StatusChangeService conflict**: Removed the call to StatusChangeService for order form status changes since it was trying to update the wrong field
3. **Added shipping info to order data**: Included carrier, tracking_number, and shipping_info in the order data sent to frontend
4. **Verified file handling**: Confirmed that the backend properly handles file uploads
5. **Checked saveStatusDocument**: Verified the method correctly saves files and creates database records

## Review

The main issues were:

1. **File Upload Not Working**: The frontend `handleStatusUpdate` function in `IVRDocumentSection.tsx` was not properly sending the file data to the backend. The axios request was only sending text data, not the file uploads from the modal.

2. **Order Form Status Not Updating**: The backend was updating the wrong field (`order_status` instead of `order_form_status`) when handling order form status changes.
3. **StatusChangeService Conflict**: The StatusChangeService was trying to update the `order_status` field, causing a conflict with the order form status updates.

The fixes involved:
1. **Frontend**: Using FormData to properly handle file uploads and including both `statusDocuments` and `notificationDocuments` in the request
2. **Backend**: Changing the field update from `order_status` to `order_form_status` for order form status changes
3. **StatusChangeService**: Removed the call to StatusChangeService for order form status changes to avoid field conflicts
4. **File Handling**: Ensuring the backend receives and processes the files correctly

This resolves both the file upload and order form status update issues.
