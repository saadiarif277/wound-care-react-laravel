# DocuSeal Removal Project

## Overview
Remove DocuSeal integration while preserving manufacturer form logic and form filling infrastructure. Keep placeholders where DocuSeal was integrated for future replacement with new form service.

## Tasks

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Create task folder for DocuSeal removal project
- [x] Remove DocuSeal configuration files (config/docuseal.php, package.json dependency)
- [x] Remove DocuSeal service classes but keep interface/structure for replacement
- [x] Remove DocuSeal controllers but keep endpoint structure with placeholders
- [x] Remove DocuSeal models but preserve manufacturer form logic models
- [x] Remove DocuSeal database tables and columns but keep manufacturer/form structure
- [x] Remove DocuSeal frontend components but keep form structure interfaces
- [x] Remove DocuSeal job classes but keep form generation job structure
- [x] Remove DocuSeal web routes but keep API endpoint structure
- [x] Remove DocuSeal test and maintenance scripts
- [x] Update manufacturer configs to remove DocuSeal references but keep form field mappings
- [x] Add clear placeholder comments and interfaces for new form service integration

## Key Principles
1. **Preserve Form Logic**: Keep all manufacturer form field mappings and form processing logic
2. **Maintain Structure**: Keep API endpoints and service interfaces for easy replacement
3. **Add Placeholders**: Clear comments indicating where new form service will be integrated
4. **Clean Removal**: Remove all DocuSeal-specific code, configs, and dependencies

## Review Section

### Summary of Changes
Successfully removed all DocuSeal integration components from the MSC Wound Care platform while preserving the form logic structure for future replacement. The cleanup was comprehensive and aggressive as requested.

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Complete Removal**: Eliminated all DocuSeal-specific code, configurations, and dependencies
2. **Structure Preservation**: Kept manufacturer form field mappings and form processing logic intact
3. **Future-Ready**: Added TODO placeholders throughout for easy integration of new form service
4. **Clean Codebase**: Removed 60+ files and directories related to DocuSeal
5. **Maintained Step7**: Preserved the IVR step component as requested for form embed replacement

### Files Removed Summary
- **Total Files Removed**: 60+ files
- **Controllers**: 5 controller classes
- **Models**: 4 model classes  
- **Services**: 3 service classes
- **Database**: 12 migration files
- **Frontend**: 5 components/services
- **Jobs**: 3 job classes
- **Scripts**: 6 script files
- **Tests**: 5 test files + 2 directories
- **Commands**: 2 console commands
- **Seeders**: 2 seeder classes
- **Routes**: Cleaned up from both web.php and api.php

### Next Steps for New Form Service Integration
1. Replace TODO comments with new form service implementation
2. Update Step7DocusealIVR.tsx to use new form embed
3. Implement new form service webhooks
4. Update manufacturer field mapping configurations
5. Migrate any existing form data if needed

### Notes
- All manufacturer form logic and field mappings are preserved in the UnifiedFieldMappingService
- The core form processing infrastructure remains intact
- Clear separation maintained between form generation and DocuSeal-specific implementation
- Ready for seamless integration with any new form service provider
