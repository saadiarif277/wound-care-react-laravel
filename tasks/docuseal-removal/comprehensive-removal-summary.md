# DocuSeal Comprehensive Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive removal of DocuSeal from the wound-care-react-laravel codebase, replacing it with a custom PDF solution using PDFtk and Azure services.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Configuration Cleanup ✓
- **AppServiceProvider.php**: DocuSeal service registration already commented out
- **config/services.php**: Removed DocuSeal configuration section
- **.env.example**: Removed DocuSeal references and updated PDF comments

### 2. Route Cleanup ✓
- **routes/web.php**: Removed DocuSeal routes and comments
- **routes/api.php**: Removed DocuSeal API routes

### 3. Model Updates ✓
- **ProductRequest.php**: Removed DocuSeal imports and updated relationships to use PDFDocument
- Created migration `2025_07_07_remove_docuseal_columns.php` to:
  - Remove docuseal_submission_id and docuseal_template_id columns
  - Add pdf_document_id and pdf_template_id columns

### 4. Service Updates ✓
- **QuickRequestService.php**: Updated to use PDF service instead of DocuSeal
- **ManufacturerEmailService.php**: Updated to use PDF documents
- **HandleQuickRequestSubmitted.php**: Updated event handler to remove DocuSeal references

### 5. Frontend Updates ✓
- **RoleBasedNavigation.tsx**: Updated menu items to use PDF Template Manager
- **CreateNew.tsx**: Updated to use pdf_document_id instead of docuseal_submission_id
- **Step7DocusealIVR.tsx**: Renamed to Step7PDFIIVR.tsx
- **quickRequest.ts**: Changed 'docuseal-ivr' step to 'pdf-ivr'

### 6. File Removals ✓
All DocuSeal-related files have been deleted:
- Controllers: DocusealController, DocusealWebhookController, DocuSealTemplateController
- Services: DocusealService, FhirDocusealIntegrationService
- Models: DocusealSubmission, DocusealTemplate, DocusealFolder
- Jobs: ProcessQuickRequestToDocusealAndFhir, GenerateDocuSealPdf, SyncDocuSealTemplateJob
- Migrations: All DocuSeal-related database migrations
- Frontend components: DocuSealViewer, DocusealTemplateViewer, DocusealEmbed, etc.
- Test files: All DocuSeal test files

### 7. Manufacturer Configuration Note
- Manufacturer config files (e.g., biowound-solutions.php) still contain `docuseal_template_id` fields
- These should be updated to `pdf_template_id` when the new PDF templates are created

## Files Modified

### Backend Files
1. `/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
2. `/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderCenterController.php`
3. `/app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php`
4. `/app/Http/Controllers/QuickRequestController.php`
5. `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/OrderReviewController.php`
6. `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/QuickRequestController.php`
7. `/app/Models/Order/ProductRequest.php`
8. `/app/Services/QuickRequestService.php`
9. `/app/Services/ManufacturerEmailService.php`
10. `/app/Services/UnifiedFieldMappingService.php`
11. `/app/Listeners/HandleQuickRequestSubmitted.php`
12. `/routes/web.php`
13. `/routes/api.php`
14. `/config/services.php`
15. `/.env.example`

### Frontend Files
1. `/resources/js/Components/Navigation/RoleBasedNavigation.tsx`
2. `/resources/js/Pages/QuickRequest/CreateNew.tsx`
3. `/resources/js/Pages/Admin/OrderCenter/Show.tsx`
4. `/resources/js/Components/IVR/ReviewAndSubmitStep.tsx`
5. `/resources/js/types/quickRequest.ts`
6. `/resources/js/Pages/QuickRequest/Components/Step7DocusealIVR.tsx` → renamed to `Step7PDFIIVR.tsx`

### Database Migration
- Created: `/database/migrations/2025_07_07_remove_docuseal_columns.php`

## Remaining Tasks

### Low Priority
1. **Update test scripts**: The test scripts in `/tests/scripts/` and `/scripts/` still reference DocuSeal
2. **Update manufacturer configs**: Individual manufacturer config files need `docuseal_template_id` changed to `pdf_template_id`

## Verification Steps

To verify the removal is complete:

```bash
# Search for any remaining DocuSeal references
grep -r "docuseal\|Docuseal" . --exclude-dir=vendor --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Check for any broken imports
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
npm run build
```

## Notes

- The new PDF system is ready to replace DocuSeal functionality
- PDF templates will be managed through the admin interface at `/admin/pdf-templates`
- The SmartEmailSender service handles manufacturer communications
- All PHI data continues to be stored in Azure FHIR, not in the local database

## Review

All critical DocuSeal references have been removed from the active codebase. The application now uses the new PDF system for document generation and manufacturer communications. Test scripts and documentation may still contain historical references but do not affect the running application.
