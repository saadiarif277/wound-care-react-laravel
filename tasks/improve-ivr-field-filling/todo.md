# IVR Form Field Filling Improvement Project

## Problem Statement
The DocuSeal IVR forms were only getting 6-7 fields filled out of potentially 40-50+ fields, resulting in poor user experience and manual data entry requirements.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Missing manufacturer configurations (e.g., Celularity)
2. AI service not using manufacturer-specific field mappings
3. Generic field mapping without exact DocuSeal field names
4. Unused JSON form examples
5. Poor field name validation

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks âœ…

- [x] **Create Celularity manufacturer config file with field mappings** (Priority: High)
  - Created `/config/manufacturers/celularity.php` with comprehensive field mappings
  - Mapped 50+ fields including patient info, insurance, provider, facility, and procedure data
  - Added support for computed fields and transformations

- [x] **Update medical AI service to load and use manufacturer configs dynamically** (Priority: High)
  - Added `load_manufacturer_config()` function to parse PHP config files
  - Added `get_manufacturer_field_mappings()` to retrieve field mappings
  - Updated `perform_basic_enhancement()` to use manufacturer-specific mappings
  - Added support for field transformations (dates, phones, booleans)

- [x] **Improve AI prompts to include exact template field names** (Priority: High)
  - Enhanced `build_system_prompt()` with manufacturer field mapping guide
  - Updated `build_user_prompt()` with specific mapping instructions and examples
  - Added manufacturer-specific context to AI prompts
  - Included field type information and transformation rules

- [x] **Add field name validation and mapping success logging** (Priority: High)
  - Enhanced `validate_enhanced_fields()` with comprehensive validation stats
  - Added detection of invalid field names with suggestions
  - Implemented detailed logging of field mapping success rates
  - Added warnings for high invalid field counts

### Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

- [ ] **Parse JSON forms to extract field patterns and create mapping dictionaries** (Priority: Medium)
  - Need to analyze JSON forms in `/docs/data-and-reference/json-forms/`
  - Extract common field patterns across manufacturers
  - Build a field pattern library for better mapping

- [ ] **Update DocuSeal integration to pre-fetch template fields** (Priority: Medium)
  - Modify Laravel DocuSeal service to fetch template fields before mapping
  - Pass template fields to AI service for better accuracy
  - Cache template field structures

- [ ] **Add field mapping metrics and monitoring** (Priority: Low)
  - Create dashboard to track field fill rates by manufacturer
  - Monitor AI confidence scores
  - Track most commonly failed fields

- [ ] **Create test scripts for field mapping validation** (Priority: Low)
  - Test each manufacturer's field mapping
  - Validate against actual DocuSeal templates
  - Create regression tests

## Implementation Details

### 1. Celularity Manufacturer Config
Created a comprehensive config file that maps source fields to exact DocuSeal field names:
- Patient fields: name, DOB, address, insurance details
- Provider fields: physician name, NPI, contact info
- Facility fields: name, NPI, address, contact details
- Procedure fields: dates, codes, wound details, product info

### 2. Medical AI Service Enhancements
- **Dynamic Config Loading**: Uses PHP to parse Laravel config files
- **Manufacturer-Aware Mapping**: Uses exact field names from configs
- **Smart Transformations**: Date formatting, phone formatting, boolean conversions
- **Computed Fields**: Combines multiple fields (e.g., first + last name)

### 3. AI Prompt Improvements
- **Manufacturer Context**: Includes specific manufacturer field guides
- **Example Mappings**: Shows AI how to map common fields
- **Strict Validation**: Only allows exact template field names
- **Format Guidelines**: Specific instructions for dates, phones, etc.

### 4. Validation & Logging
- **Field Validation Stats**: Tracks valid, invalid, empty, transformed fields
- **Success Rate Metrics**: Calculates and logs field mapping success percentage
- **Invalid Field Detection**: Identifies and logs fields that don't match template
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights when issues detected

## Expected Results
- **Current State**: 6-7 fields filled (15-20% fill rate)
- **After High Priority Tasks**: 40-50 fields filled (80%+ fill rate)
- **After All Tasks**: Consistent 85-90% fill rate with monitoring

## Key Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. `/config/manufacturers/celularity.php` - New manufacturer config
2. `/scripts/medical_ai_service.py` - Enhanced with:
   - Manufacturer config loading
   - Improved AI prompts
   - Better field validation
   - Comprehensive logging

### New Functions Added
- `load_manufacturer_config()` - Loads PHP configs from Laravel
- `get_manufacturer_field_mappings()` - Gets field mappings for manufacturer
- Enhanced `perform_basic_enhancement()` - Uses manufacturer configs
- Enhanced `validate_enhanced_fields()` - Better validation and logging

## Next Steps
1. Test with Celularity IVR forms to verify improved fill rate
2. Create configs for other manufacturers without configs
3. Implement template field pre-fetching in Laravel
4. Build monitoring dashboard for field mapping metrics

## Review

### Summary of Changes
This implementation significantly improves the IVR form field filling capability by:
1. Creating manufacturer-specific field configurations
2. Making the AI service manufacturer-aware
3. Using exact DocuSeal field names instead of generic mappings
4. Adding comprehensive validation and logging

### Impact
- Reduced manual data entry for providers
- Improved form completion accuracy
- Better user experience with pre-filled forms
- Clear visibility into field mapping performance

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed hardcoded field mappings
- Added extensible manufacturer config system
- Improved error handling and logging
- Created foundation for future improvements
