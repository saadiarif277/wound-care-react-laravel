## Review

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the ability for admins to enter and update shipping and tracking numbers when orders are in `confirmed_by_manufacturer` status. The implementation ensures that:

1. **Shipping Information Management**: Admins can now enter shipping details when changing order status to `confirmed_by_manufacturer` only
2. **Inline Editing**: For confirmed orders, admins can directly edit carrier and tracking number fields without opening a modal
3. **Status Independence**: IVR status and Order status are properly separated and don't interfere with each other
4. **Visual Feedback**: Shipping information is displayed in the header with a distinct purple badge for easy identification
5. **Validation**: Both carrier and tracking number are required when updating to `confirmed_by_manufacturer` status

### Key Features
- **Required Fields**: Shipping information is mandatory only for `confirmed_by_manufacturer` status updates
- **Real-time Updates**: Inline editing provides immediate feedback
- **Status Persistence**: Shipping info is saved in both individual fields and as structured JSON
- **Admin Only**: Shipping field editing is restricted to admin users
- **Audit Trail**: All shipping updates are logged with timestamps and user information

### Technical Implementation
- Frontend: React components with TypeScript interfaces
- Backend: Laravel controller with proper validation and data persistence
- Database: Utilizes existing carrier, tracking_number, and shipping_info fields
- API: RESTful endpoints for status updates with shipping information

### Recent Updates
- **Shipping Information Scope**: Shipping information is now only required and displayed for `confirmed_by_manufacturer` status
- **StatusUpdateModal**: Only shows shipping fields for confirmed orders
- **IVRDocumentSection**: Only displays shipping information for confirmed orders
- **Backend Controller**: Only saves shipping info when status is `confirmed_by_manufacturer`
- **Edit Functionality**: Replaced inline editing with a proper edit button that opens a modal for updating shipping information

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and maintains consistency with the current architecture while adding the requested functionality. Shipping information is now properly scoped to only confirmed orders as requested.
