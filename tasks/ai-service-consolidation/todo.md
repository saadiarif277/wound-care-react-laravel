# AI Service Consolidation Plan

## Overview
The system currently has multiple AI services with overlapping functionality for DocuSeal field mapping. This plan consolidates them into a single, efficient service that correctly integrates with the Python medical AI service.

## Current State Analysis

### Services to be Consolidated/Removed:
1. **MedicalAIServiceManager** (`app/Services/AI/MedicalAIServiceManager.php`)
   - Issues: Calls wrong endpoint `/api/v1/map-fields` (doesn't exist)
   - Has useful features: health check, fallback, service startup
   - Status: Remove but preserve useful features

2. **OptimizedMedicalAiService** (`app/Services/Medical/OptimizedMedicalAiService.php`)
   - Correctly calls `/api/v1/enhance-mapping`
   - Used by QuickRequestOrchestrator
   - Status: **KEEP as primary service**

3. **IntelligentFieldMappingService** (`app/Services/AI/IntelligentFieldMappingService.php`)
   - Uses AzureFoundryService
   - Has its own AI logic
   - Status: Remove (duplicate functionality)

4. **AiFormFillerService** (`app/Services/AiFormFillerService.php`)
   - Calls wrong endpoint `/map-fields`
   - Similar functionality to others
   - Status: Remove

5. **AzureFoundryService** (`app/Services/AI/AzureFoundryService.php`)
   - Direct Azure OpenAI integration
   - Could be useful for direct AI calls
   - Status: **KEEP for direct Azure AI needs**

6. **DynamicFieldMappingService** (`app/Services/DocuSeal/DynamicFieldMappingService.php`)
   - DocuSeal specific, uses correct port (8081)
   - Has useful DocuSeal integration
   - Status: Merge into OptimizedMedicalAiService

7. **LLMFieldMapper** (`app/Services/DocuSeal/LLMFieldMapper.php`)
   - Another LLM service
   - Status: Remove (duplicate)

8. **DocumentIntelligenceService** (`app/Services/DocumentIntelligenceService.php`)
   - Azure Document Intelligence for OCR
   - Different purpose (OCR vs field mapping)
   - Status: **KEEP (different purpose)**

9. **TemplateIntelligenceService** (`app/Services/TemplateIntelligenceService.php`)
   - Template analysis
   - Status: Remove if not actively used

## Service Usage Dependencies

### MedicalAIServiceManager
- Used in: `routes/debug.php` (debug endpoints only)
- Safe to remove after migrating debug endpoints

### IntelligentFieldMappingService  
- Used in: `DocusealService` (optional injection)
- Used in: `UnifiedFieldMappingService` (class_exists check)
- Used in: `scripts/test-ai-mapping-with-biowound.php` (test script)
- Action: Update DocusealService to use OptimizedMedicalAiService

### AiFormFillerService
- Used in: `DocumentProcessingController`
- Used in: `TestAiFormFiller` command
- Registered in: `AppServiceProvider`
- Action: Update controller to use OptimizedMedicalAiService or remove if OCR-specific

### DynamicFieldMappingService
- Used in: DocuSeal dynamic mapping config
- Action: Merge functionality into OptimizedMedicalAiService

### LLMFieldMapper
- No direct usage found
- Safe to remove

### TemplateIntelligenceService
- Used in: Template analysis workflows
- Action: Check if actively used, likely safe to remove

## Configuration Status

### Port Configuration - VERIFIED CORRECT
- Python service runs on port 8081 (confirmed in test)
- Config correctly uses port 8081
- No changes needed
