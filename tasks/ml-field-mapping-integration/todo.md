- `getMLAnalytics()` - Get analytics from ML system
- `triggerMLTraining()` - Trigger training process

**Integration Features**:
- Seamless fallback to traditional mapping when ML fails
- ML confidence scores for all predictions
- Metadata tracking for ML-enhanced mappings
- Performance monitoring and logging

### 4. Training Data Collection ✅
**File**: `app/Services/ML/MLTrainingDataCollector.php`

Created a comprehensive data collection system that:
- Collects from multiple Laravel data sources:
  - IVR field mappings
  - PDF field metadata
  - Template field mappings
  - Docuseal audit logs
- Batches and submits training data to ML system
- Maps medical categories to canonical fields
- Includes automated scheduling and caching
- Provides collection statistics and monitoring

**Data Sources**:
- `ivr_field_mappings` table - User-verified mappings
- `pdf_field_metadata` table - AI-categorized fields
- `template_field_mappings` table - Manual template mappings  
- `mapping_audit_logs` table - Docuseal mapping changes

### 5. ML Confidence Scoring Component ✅
**File**: `resources/js/Components/ML/FieldMappingConfidence.tsx`

Created a React component that:
- Displays ML confidence scores for field mappings
- Shows mapping method badges (ML, Fallback, Heuristic)
- Provides user feedback interface (thumbs up/down)
- Displays alternative suggestions with confidence scores
- Shows unmapped fields warnings
- Includes educational information about ML system

**UI Features**:
- Real-time confidence visualization
- Interactive feedback collection
- Alternative suggestions expansion
- Color-coded confidence indicators
- Method-specific badges and icons

### 6. ML Analytics Dashboard ✅
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/Admin/MLAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`

Created a comprehensive analytics dashboard with:
- System status monitoring (models loaded, training data size)
- Performance metrics (accuracy rate, confidence distribution)
- Manufacturer-specific breakdowns
- Time-series performance trends
- Field mapping success/failure analysis
- Recent activity feed
- Export capabilities and auto-refresh

**Analytics Features**:
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Manufacturer performance comparison
- Field-level success rate analysis
- Training status and control
- Data export functionality

## Configuration

### ML System Configuration ✅
**File**: `config/ml.php`

Created comprehensive configuration with:
- ML server connection settings
- Model configuration and paths
- Data collection parameters
- Analytics and caching settings
- Security and performance options
- Development and testing modes

**Environment Variables**:
```env
ML_FIELD_MAPPING_ENABLED=true
ML_FIELD_MAPPING_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
ML_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6
ML_AUTO_TRAINING=true
ML_DATA_COLLECTION_ENABLED=true
```

## Integration Points

### 1. IVR Forms Integration
The ML system integrates with existing IVR forms through:
- Enhanced field mapping in `ProductSelectorQuickRequest.tsx`
- ML predictions for manufacturer-specific forms
- Confidence scoring for field mappings
- User feedback collection for continuous improvement

### 2. UnifiedFieldMappingService Integration
- ML bridge injected via dependency injection
- Seamless fallback to traditional mapping methods
- ML results included in mapping metadata
- Performance logging and analytics

### 3. Training Data Pipeline
- Automated collection from existing Laravel tables
- Batch processing and submission to ML system
- Scheduled data collection (configurable intervals)
- Quality scoring and validation

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Accuracy
- ML predictions provide higher accuracy than heuristic methods
- Continuous learning from user feedback
- Manufacturer-specific model training
- Context-aware field mapping
