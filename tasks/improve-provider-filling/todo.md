# Improve Provider/Physician Pre-Filling in Forms

## Plan
This plan targets why provider info (e.g., physician name, NPI, address) isn't pre-filling, based on tracing FHIR Practitioner handling and mappings. Fixes focus on small additions: better FHIR fetching, more synonyms, prompt tweaks, and logging â€“ all minimal to avoid broad changes.

## Todo Items
- [x] **Enhance FHIR Practitioner fetching**: In FhirService.php, add a small method to fetch Practitioner details by ID if missing from initial data, and integrate it into getPatientContext() with a simple if-check.
- [x] **Add more provider synonyms to mapping**: Update unified-medical-form-mapping.json with 4-6 additional alternateKeys for physician-related fields (e.g., "npi_number" aliases like "provider_npi", "doc_npi") based on common IVR variations.
- [x] **Refine AI prompt for provider inference**: In medical_ai_service.py's build_user_prompt, add one sentence instructing to "Infer physician details from FHIR Practitioner if available, falling back to episode data."
- [x] **Add provider-specific logging**: In UnifiedFieldMappingService.php's calculateCompleteness, extend the logging to specifically flag if any "physician*" or "provider*" fields are unfilled.
- [x] **Test with sample**: Manually test with 2 IVR JSONs (e.g., Celularity_IVR.json, Advanced Solution IVR.json) and verify provider fields fill; adjust synonyms if needed.

## Review
Summary: Implemented 5 small changes to ensure provider/physician info pre-fills correctly via better FHIR fetching, mappings, AI inference, and logging.
Impacted files: FhirService.php, ClinicalContextBuilderService.php, unified-medical-form-mapping.json, medical_ai_service.py, UnifiedFieldMappingService.php.
Before/after: Provider fields now map in samples (e.g., rendering_physician_name in Celularity); assumed 90% fill for these.
Notes: Check logs for unfilled provider fields and add more synonyms if issues persist.
