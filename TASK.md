# MSC Wound Care Portal - Development Task List

> **RBAC Architecture**: This project uses a robust Role + Permission based access control system with `User ‚Üî Role ‚Üî Permission` relationships. All access control is handled through permission-based middleware (`$this->middleware('permission:permission-name')`) and the `$user->hasPermission()` method. **No hardcoded role checks are used.**

## üö® CRITICAL RBAC FIXES NEEDED - Office Manager Role

### Office Manager API Endpoint Failures üî• IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
*Multiple 403/500 errors due to missing permissions and route protection issues*

**Current Failures:**
- [x] **`/products` endpoint**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Added proper permission-based route protection
- [x] **`/providers` endpoint**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Added `view-providers` permission to Office Manager role
- [x] **`/mac-validation` endpoint**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Added `manage-mac-validation` permission to Office Manager role
- [x] **`/pre-authorization` endpoint**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Added `manage-pre-authorization` permission to Office Manager role

**Required Permission Updates:**
- [x] **Add to Office Manager role**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Added `view-providers`, `view-product-requests`, `view-products`
- [x] **Add MAC validation permissions**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Office managers now have `manage-mac-validation` permission
- [x] **Add Pre-Auth permissions**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Office managers now have `manage-pre-authorization` permission
- [x] **Add proper route protection**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Products routes now use `permission:view-products` middleware

**RBAC Compliance Requirements:**
Based on MSC-MVP Product Request Flow documentation, Office Managers should:
- ‚úÖ **Can see product catalog** (but without MSC pricing/savings)
- ‚úÖ **Can create product requests** for their facility
- ‚úÖ **Can view providers** in their facility for request management
- ‚úÖ **Can manage pre-authorization** requests for their patients
- ‚úÖ **Can access MAC validation** for compliance checking
- ‚ùå **Cannot see MSC pricing** or financial savings data
- ‚ùå **Cannot see commission rates** or financial analytics

**Technical Implementation:**
1. ‚úÖ **Update UserRoleSeeder.php**: COMPLETED - Added missing permissions to office-manager role
2. ‚úÖ **Update Product Routes**: COMPLETED - Added proper permission middleware to product routes
3. ‚úÖ **Create MAC Validation permissions**: COMPLETED - Added limited MAC validation access for office managers
4. ‚úÖ **Test Permission Filtering**: COMPLETED - Financial data filtering maintained at API level

**Implementation Summary:**
- **New Permissions Added**: `view-products`, `view-providers`, `view-product-requests`, `manage-pre-authorization`, `manage-mac-validation`
- **Routes Updated**: Products routes now use permission-based middleware instead of just `auth`
- **MAC Controller Updated**: Updated to use `manage-mac-validation` permission consistently
- **Database Seeded**: All new permissions applied to Office Manager role in database
- **RBAC Compliance**: Maintained 100% permission-based access control (no hardcoded role checks)

**Security Notes:**
- Office managers need functional access to complete product request workflow
- Financial data filtering must be maintained at API level (already implemented in ProductController)
- All new permissions must follow existing RBAC patterns (no hardcoded role checks)

## üìã Best Practices & Development Guidelines

### RBAC Development Pattern
```php
// ‚úÖ Correct: Permission-based middleware
$this->middleware('permission:view-financials')->only(['index']);

// ‚úÖ Correct: Check user permissions
if ($request->user()->hasPermission('edit-products')) {
    // Allow action
}

// ‚ùå Wrong: Direct role checks
if ($user->hasRole('admin')) { // Don't do this
```

### Frontend Role Handling
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Use roleRestrictions from backend
const { roleRestrictions } = usePage().props;
if (roleRestrictions.can_view_financials) {
    // Show financial data
}

// ‚ùå Wrong: Hardcoded role checks
if (user.role === 'admin') { // Don't do this
```

### API Development
- Use permission middleware for all protected routes
- Pass roleRestrictions to frontend in all API responses
- Filter sensitive data at the API level based on permissions
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all actions

### Testing Strategy
- Write feature tests for all RBAC scenarios
- Test permission boundaries thoroughly
- Include integration tests for external APIs
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)

### 6. CreateOrganizationRequest RBAC Compliance Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED
*Fixed hardcoded role check in authorization by replacing it with permission-based approach*

**Security Issues Fixed:**
- [x] **Hardcoded Role Dependencies** - Removed hardcoded 'admin' role reference that didn't exist
- [x] **Permission-Based Authorization** - Implemented 'manage-customers' permission check instead
- [x] **Auth Facade Usage** - Used proper Auth facade instead of auth() helper for consistency
- [x] **RBAC Compliance** - Aligned with project's permission-based security model

**Security Benefits:**
- Role-agnostic authorization based on capabilities
- Future-proof against role name changes
- Consistent with other controllers' authorization patterns
- Proper separation of authentication and authorization concerns

### 7. TeamController Authentication & Authorization Security Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
*Added missing authentication and authorization middleware to protect sensitive team data*

**Security Issues Fixed:**
- [x] **Missing Authentication** - Added 'auth' middleware to require user login
- [x] **Missing Authorization** - Added 'permission:view-team' middleware for access control
- [x] **Unprotected Endpoints** - Both index() and show() methods now properly secured
- [x] **Consistent Security Model** - Aligned with project's RBAC permission system

**Security Implementation:**
- Constructor middleware: `['auth', 'permission:view-team']`
- Uses existing 'view-team' permission from RBAC seed data
- Protects against unauthorized access to team member information
- Maintains consistency with other protected controllers

**Permission Structure:**
- Required permission: `view-team` (View team members)
- Available to roles: `msc-rep` (MSC Sales Rep with team management)
- Falls back to 403 Forbidden for unauthorized users
