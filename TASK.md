# MSC Wound Care Portal - Development Task List

> **RBAC Architecture**: This project uses a robust Role + Permission based access control system with `User ↔ Role ↔ Permission` relationships. All access control is handled through permission-based middleware (`$this->middleware('permission:permission-name')`) and the `$user->hasPermission()` method. **No hardcoded role checks are used.**

## 📋 Best Practices & Development Guidelines

### RBAC Development Pattern
```php
// ✅ Correct: Permission-based middleware
$this->middleware('permission:view-financials')->only(['index']);

// ✅ Correct: Check user permissions
if ($request->user()->hasPermission('edit-products')) {
    // Allow action
}

// ❌ Wrong: Direct role checks
if ($user->hasRole('admin')) { // Don't do this
```

### Frontend Role Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Use roleRestrictions from backend
const { roleRestrictions } = usePage().props;
if (roleRestrictions.can_view_financials) {
    // Show financial data
}

// ❌ Wrong: Hardcoded role checks
if (user.role === 'admin') { // Don't do this
```

### API Development
- Use permission middleware for all protected routes
- Pass roleRestrictions to frontend in all API responses
- Filter sensitive data at the API level based on permissions
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all actions

### Testing Strategy
- Write feature tests for all RBAC scenarios
- Test permission boundaries thoroughly
- Include integration tests for external APIs
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
