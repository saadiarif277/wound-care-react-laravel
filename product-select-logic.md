üìÑ MSC Platform ‚Äì Product Selection + Logic (PRD)
1. Overview
Feature Name: Product Selection for Order Request
 Module: Order Workflow ‚Äì Provider & OM Portal
 Target Users: Office Managers (OMs), Providers
 Priority: High
 Owner: Product Team

2. Objective
Enable providers and OMs to select only eligible, reimbursable products they‚Äôve been onboarded with, while applying payer-specific, size-based, and state-based filters to reduce claim denials and ensure compliance.

3. User Stories
As an OM or Provider, I want to view only products I‚Äôm eligible to order so I don‚Äôt mistakenly request items that may be denied or uncovered.
As a Provider, I want to see discount pricing to make informed decisions on cost-efficient care.
As a User, I want alerts when products require special review so I can follow up with the appropriate team.



4. Functional Requirements

Area
Design Notes

Cart Component
Separate from product list; displays selected product, sizes, quantities
Warnings
Soft validation banners (not hard stops) for size limits, repeat orders
Medicare >450 Flow
Modal popup with CTA to email MSC Admin
Role-Based Display
Provider sees ASP discount; OM does not
Product Catalog
Separate tab with full product catalog and request-for-access option

8. Open Questions  
Should PPO coverage of BioVance be confirmed per plan or default to always shown?
Products may vary based on Payor 


Should AmnioAMP be grayed out (vs. hidden) when excluded by Medicare logic?
	- Hidden
Can providers override wound size range restrictions with a note or warning?
	- warning with permissions to proceed and needs confirmation from Ashley
Who handles review for ‚ÄúConsultation Required‚Äù workflows?
	- Routed to MSC Admin (Ashley)
Need confirmation on the states noted above. Are Medicaid state rules expected to change frequently?


Should MAC validation warnings be actionable or just informational?
