# IVR & Order Document Logics:

## Episode-Level Documents (Shared):

### IVR: One per Patient + Manufacturer combination
Applies to ALL orders within that episode
Patient gets ONE IVR verification that covers multiple orders
## Order-Level Documents (Individual):

### Order Forms: One per specific order
Each order gets its own unique form
Even within the same episode

##Association Strategy:
Use episode_id for IVR documents (shared)
Use order_id for Order Forms (individual)
Track via external_id or docuseal_submission_id in webhooks

## Download Logic:

Order details page shows BOTH documents
IVR comes from episode relationship (shared indicator)
Order Form comes from direct order relationship---
