## Development Approach

- **RBAC Implementation**: Complete RBAC system implementation achieved with comprehensive role-based access control
- **UI/UX Focus**: Role-specific user interface features fully integrated with RBAC system
- **Feature-First Development**: All major features now integrated with RBAC system
- **Backend Security**: All controllers audited and updated to use proper RBAC middleware patterns
- **Commission Access Control**: Fixed commission visibility issues with proper role-based access levels

## Recent Completions (Latest Session)

### **RBAC System Audit & Commission Visibility Fix**
- **Backend Controllers Audit**: Complete audit of 15 controllers with 100% RBAC compliance achieved
- **Commission Visibility Issue Resolution**: 
  - **Root Cause**: CommissionDisplay component was using `can_view_financials` instead of `commission_access_level`
  - **Fix**: Updated to use proper `commission_access_level` ('none'/'limited'/'full') for role-based commission access
  - **Role Updates**: Added `commission_access: 'full'` to MSC_REP, MSC_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN roles in UserRole model
  - **Frontend Updates**: Updated Product Index/Show pages and PricingDisplay component to use commission_access_level
- **Final Role-Based Access Matrix**:
  - **Provider**: National ASP + MSC Price + Savings, NO commission data
  - **Office Manager**: National ASP only, NO commission data
  - **MSC SubRep**: Limited commission access  
  - **MSC Rep/Admin/SuperAdmin**: Full commission access
- **Technical Approach**: All changes followed established RBAC patterns without hardcoding, using existing middleware-based protection

### **RBAC Established Pattern Documentation**
- **Middleware-based protection**: `$this->middleware('permission:permission-name')->only(['methods'])`
- **CheckPermission middleware**: Already registered (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckPermission.php`)
- **User permissions**: `$request->user()->hasPermission($permission)` method
- **Frontend roleRestrictions**: Passed from controllers to React components
- **NO direct role checks**: Avoid `hasRole()`, `isSuperAdmin()`, etc. in business logic
- **Commission Access Levels**: 'none', 'limited', 'full' based on role configuration
